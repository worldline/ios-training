## What is iOS development ?

iOS development consists of developing applications that target iPhones, iPads, macOS, iWatch and Apple TV.
There are many ways to achieve this:

- Using the official frameworks and tools developped by Apple
- Using 3rd party frameworks and tools such as Capacitor and FLutter

This training focuses on iOS development using the official tools and frameworks proposed by Apple. Our development stack will consist of the following items:

- Language: Swift
- Framework: SwiftUI
- IDE: Xcode

In addition to that, It is also possible to leverage the Swift language in order to develop console apps and servers on Window, Linux, macOS.

## Historty

The early days of iOS development were done using the Objective-C language, the CocoaTouch Framework and -the good old- Xcode.
This ecosystem was basic but quite powerful and allowed to develop amazing apps.
The continous updates from Apple made development much more developer friendly.
For example, memory management became automatic (thanks toARC) and the layout system became capable of adapting to different screen sizes.

In WWDC 2014, Apple annouced the Swift language a modern replacement for Objective-C.
Following that, apple announced during the next WWDC SwiftUI as the replacement for CocoaTouch.

As of 2021, the majority of new iOS projects use Swift and SwiftUI with CocoaTouch as a fallback.
