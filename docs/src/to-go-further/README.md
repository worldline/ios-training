# To go further

This training was introduction on Swift and SwiftUI.
It just scratched the surface of developing for the Apple development.
There are many things that we didn't explore such as the accessibility, hardware features such as geolocation and the technical aspects of the developer account (certificates, provisioning profiles, etc.).


To go further, it is advised to watch the videos from Apple's [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/) (WorldWide Developer Conference - pronounced "dubdub dee cee").
There many other resources available online that you should pick and choose depending on the needs.
