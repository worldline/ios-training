# Swift

Swift is the official programming language for developping iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and AppleTV apps. It can also target other platforms such as Windows, Linux and Android.

The source code of the language is hosted on [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) github repository.

## A quick tour of some features

Swift has modern and interesting features. Here some quick notable ones:

- Swift is statically typed and support implicit typing.
- `var` creates mutable variables.
- `let` creates immutable variables or constants depending on the type.
- String interpolation is available with this syntax `\(expression)`.
- Parenthesis are not necessary in `if`, `for`, `while` and `switch` statements
- for-each is the only type of for loop available
- Types are not nullable by default. More about null safety later.
- Functionnal programming features are supported such as Higher-order functions and functions as 1st class items.
- Object oriented programming is supported however, interfaces are called protocols.

The following code illustrates some of the features listed above.

In the following sections, we will delve into more features.

## Functions

The declaration of functions in swift has the following peculiartities:

- Arguments are named and ordered. This means that when you call a function, you must specify the name of the arguments in the correct order.
- You can make an argument anonymous by naming it `_` during the declaration.
-

Swift allows to use functions as first class items. This allows to store function references into variables, pass functions as arguments to other functions and return a function from a function.
