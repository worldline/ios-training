# Mini project

The final chapter of this training will ask you to create a SwiftUI app from scratch.
It consists of a movie explorer app with the following features:

- List movies.
- View the details of the selected one.
- Search for a movie.
- The app requires the user to be logged in and allows him to register.
- The app remembers the logged in user after a restart.
- The list of movies is locally cached.
- The app uses [this API](https://vue-js-backend.herokuapp.com/api-docs/#/) for the authenticating and searching for movies (an empty search string returns all the movies).
