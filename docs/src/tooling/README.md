## If you want to only learn Swift

If you don't have access to a macOS system or want to just learn the swift language, you can install the standalone [swift toolchain from this link](https://swift.org/download/).
Please follow the installation instructions that correspond to your system: [windows](https://swift.org/download/#windows), [linux](https://swift.org/download/#linux) and [macOS](https://swift.org/download/#Installation).

Since Xcode is not available on Windows and Linux, you can fallback to VSCode as your swift IDE.
