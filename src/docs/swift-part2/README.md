# Swift (part 2)

## Object oriented programming features

Swift supports most Object oriented features: classes, instances, encapsulation, simple inheritance, overriding, overloading, compositions, polymorphism and access control.
There are some differences and additional features that are highlighted below:

- Multiple inheritance of classes and abstract classes are not supported. 
- *Interfaces* are named *protocols* and they are used a lot by swift developers to the point that there is a programming technique called **Protocol oriented programming**.
- Extensions allow to add functions and conform to additional protocols outside of the original class declaration.
This has many uses.
For example, we can add methods to the standard String class.

In additions to classes, structs in swift are very powerful and provide similar features than classes with some exceptions.

## Use structs by default

As the title says and as surprising as it seems for developers coming from other languages, Apple recommends using [structs by default instead of classes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/choosing-between-structures-and-classes).
More precisely, when we want to add a new data type, we should not assume that it should be a class and check if a structure is more relevant.
Apple provides the following recommendations:

- Use structures by default.
- Use classes when you need Objective-C interoperability.
- Use classes when you need to control the identity of the data youâ€™re modeling.
- Use structures along with protocols to adopt behavior by sharing implementations.

We note that structures are the default choice mostly because they value types.
This makes the code more predictable because changes cannot come somewhere from a parent call.
In addition to that, structures have similar features than classes in Swift.
They support properties, methods, [subscripts](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Subscripts.html), initializers, extensions and conforming to protocols.
The features that are only available in classes [are as follows](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html):

- Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
- Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
- Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
- Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

Another advantage of structs is that they are more friendly with functional programming.
We'll talk about this in the next section.

## Functional programming features

Functional programming revolves around [three main concepts](https://flexiple.com/ios/introduction-to-functional-programming-using-swift/): pure functions, immutable objects and declarative programming.

Pure functions are functions that do not have side effects and will thus return always the same output given the same input.
Swift allows to create pure functions but does not provide compile time guarantees that a function is pure.

Immutable objects can be created using classes with constant properties (declared with `let`).
Another common practice is to use structs for [many good reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24232845).
One of the most notable ones is that structs are passed around by value and thus are more relevant in the functional paradigm where we want to avoid side effects.

Declarative programming can be easily explained as a way of programming that is centered [around telling what to do and not how to do it](https://blog.ndepend.com/declarative-programming-depth/).
This allows to obtain a clear and more maintainable code.
For example, when we want to filter a table, a for loop is not declarative (we say imperative in this case) while the SQL syntax is considered declarative.
Declarative programing is possible in Swift through chaining functions and passing functions as arguments.
Indeed, we have seen earlier, Swift has 1st class support for functions.
In addition to that, we can find declarative APIs in the standard Swift library and in Swift UI.
The latter will be explored in a different chapter.
For now, let's illustrate this part by processing a list of strings using only declarative APIs provided by Swift and no for loops.

Swift has many more features and provides a rich standard library.
We'll explore them as needed in the next sections.
For now, let's create some UIs in the next chapter.
